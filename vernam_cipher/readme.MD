## Vernam cipher in Rust 

- It is an unbreakable cryptosystem. It represents the message as a sequence of 0s and
1s.
- This can be accomplished by writing all numbers in binary, for example, or by using
ASCII. The key is a random sequence of 0‟s and 1‟s of same length as the message.
> Once a key is used, it is discarded and never used again.

The system can be expressed as follows:
```
Ci = Pi ^ Ki
Ci - ith binary digit of cipher text 
Pi - ith binary digit of plaintext 
Ki - ith binary digit of key
^ – exclusive OR operation
 ```

Thus the cipher text is generated by performing the bitwise XOR of the plaintext
and the key. Decryption uses the same key. Because of the properties of XOR,
decryption simply involves the same bitwise operation:
`Pi = Ci ^ Ki`<br>
